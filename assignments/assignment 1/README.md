# Building a simple image search algorithm

The dataset is a collection of over 1000 images of flowers, sampled from 17 different species. The dataset comes from the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, and full details of the data can be found [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/).

# Objective of the exercise
- Define a particular image that you want to work with
- For that image
  - Extract the colour histogram using ```OpenCV```
- Extract colour histograms for all of the **other* images in the data
- Compare the histogram of our chosen image to all of the other histograms 
  - For this, use the ```cv2.compareHist()``` function with the ```cv2.HISTCMP_CHISQR``` metric
- Find the five images which are most simlar to the target image
  - Save a CSV file to the folder called ```out```, showing the five most similar images and the distance metric:

|Filename|Distance]
|---|---|
|target|0.0|
|filename1|---|
|filename2|---|


## Notes
The chosen image that we are trying to find the most similar pictures to is a picture of a daffodil. However, none of the
top 5 chosen most similar images are of daffodils. This highlights the flaws of the histogram-comparison method, and suggests 
that other methods might be more suitable for finding similar pictures.
